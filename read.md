1. Import the requests Library
python
Copy code
import requests
Purpose: This library allows you to send HTTP requests to a server to fetch data from the internet.
2. Download the Word List
python
Copy code
url = "https://public.websites.umich.edu/~jlawler/wordlist"
response = requests.get(url)
word_list = response.text.splitlines()
url: This is the address where the word list is located.
requests.get(url): This function sends a request to the given URL to fetch the data.
response.text: This contains the content of the response (the word list as a string).
splitlines(): This splits the string into a list of lines (each line is a word).
3. Create a List to Hold Palindromes
python
Copy code
palindromes = []
Purpose: This creates an empty list where we will store words that are palindromes.
4. Check Each Word to See if Itâ€™s a Palindrome
python
Copy code
for index, word in enumerate(word_list):
    if word == word[::-1]:
        palindromes.append((index, word))
enumerate(word_list): This loops through each word in the word_list and also gives the index of each word.
word[::-1]: This reverses the word. For example, 'abc'[::-1] gives 'cba'.
if word == word[::-1]: This checks if the word is the same as its reversed version. If it is, then it's a palindrome.
palindromes.append((index, word)): If the word is a palindrome, add a tuple containing its index and the word to the palindromes list.
5. Print the List of Palindromes with Their Indices
python
Copy code
print(f"Final list of palindromes ({len(palindromes)}):")
for index, word in palindromes:
    print(f"Index: {index}, Palindrome: {word}")
len(palindromes): This gets the total number of palindromes found.
print(f"Final list of palindromes ({len(palindromes)}):"): This prints a message with the total count of palindromes.
for index, word in palindromes:: This loops through each tuple in the palindromes list.
print(f"Index: {index}, Palindrome: {word}"): This prints the index and the palindrome word.
In summary:

The code fetches a list of words from the internet.
It checks each word to see if it reads the same forwards and backwards (a palindrome).
It collects and prints the palindromes along with their positions in the original list.
